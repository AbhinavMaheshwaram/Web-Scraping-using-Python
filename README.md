This Python script performs web scraping and data analysis from the results page of the 2022 Hero Up 5K Run, located at [https://www.hubertiming.com/](https://www.hubertiming.com/). 

### Dependencies

* BeautifulSoup4
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Steps:

1. **Import libraries:** Necessary libraries for data manipulation, web scraping, and plotting are imported.
2. **Fetch website content:** The script fetches the HTML content of the webpage using `urlopen` and parses it with BeautifulSoup.
3. **Extract data:** It extracts table rows (`<tr>`) containing runner information, including names, teams, and gun times.
4. **Clean data:** Extracted data is cleaned using regular expressions to remove unwanted characters and formatting.
5. **Create DataFrame:** A pandas DataFrame is created to organize the cleaned data.
6. **Manipulate data:** Data manipulations include:
    * Splitting rows into individual columns.
    * Removing unnecessary rows and columns.
    * Renaming columns with meaningful labels.
    * Handling missing values (NaN).
    * Converting gun time format to minutes.
7. **Analyze data:**
    * Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) are calculated for runner minutes.
    * Distribution of runner minutes is visualized using boxplots and histograms.
    * Gender-based comparisons are performed using boxplots and density plots.
8. **(Optional) Save data:** The script can be modified to save the final DataFrame to an Excel file using `df.to_excel('output_data.xlsx', index=False)`.

### Notes:

* The script assumes the website structure remains consistent. Any changes to the website structure might require adjustments to the data extraction logic.
* Error handling is not implemented in this example script. Consider adding error handling mechanisms for robustness.
